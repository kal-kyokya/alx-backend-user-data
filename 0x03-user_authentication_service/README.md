			* vim
			* emacs
	->	All files will be interpreted/compiled on:
			* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

	->	All files should end with a new line
	->	The first line of all files should be exactly:
			* #!/usr/bin/env python3
	->	A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
	->	All code should use:
			* The pycodestyle style (version 2.5.*)

			* python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
	->	All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation:
			* python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
			* python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
